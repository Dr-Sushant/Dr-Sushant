👨‍⚕️ Clinician × Biomedical Data Scientist  
Building clinically grounded ML systems for imaging, risk modeling, and decision support.


🚀 Flagship Projects

• Anesthesia Drift Detector  
  ML-based system for predicting anesthetic depth drift and patient risk using perioperative data.

• QML Molecular Classification  
  Quantum-inspired embeddings for molecular classification (2nd Prize, QPoland 2025).

• HCC Extractor (Hierarchical Condition Category)  
  Clinical NLP pipeline for automated risk coding from unstructured medical text.


🧠 What I Care About

• Translating clinical ambiguity into machine-readable signals  
• Evaluating ML models beyond accuracy (drift, safety, bias)  
• Building AI systems that clinicians can trust—not just demo
